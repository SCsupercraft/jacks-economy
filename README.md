## About Jack's Economy

**Jack's Economy** is a solution for **modpack authors** and/or **server owners** to create a _server-wide_ admin shop. The purpose of this mod is to provide neat looking currency and machines necessary for setting up an admin shop, **item sinks** (automated selling and buying of items using RF or [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) rotational power), **custom progression** (thanks to the optional [Game Stages](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/game-stages) integration), and more!

The idea was inspired from modpacks such as [Create: Above and Beyond](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-above-and-beyond) which contain a unique shop system to enhance progression and give purpose to farming or collecting rare resources. This mod takes those ideas and centralizes them into one _dedicated mod_ that is super simple to use for both authors and players.

### Features

-   Automated buying and selling of items! (useful for factory packs, progression packs, or packs that wish to have an item sinking mechanic)
-   Manual buying and selling of items through the admin shop! (useful for **gating progression** using [Game Stages](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/game-stages), providing a centralized admin shop, as well as providing a place to buy/gate manifests for automatic buying and selling mentioned above)
-   Lots of cool mod integrations and compatibility! [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create), [Game Stages](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/game-stages), and [Curios](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios)!
-   Easy setup and configuration for authors and admins! (All setup can be done using our **custom GUI editor**. No complicated text file editing!)
-   _Convenient for players!_ (modpack authors can choose between two different player currency styles to suit individual modpack needs. Both styles come with wallets and machines to facilitate buying and selling items to and from the admin shop)
-   And more!!!
