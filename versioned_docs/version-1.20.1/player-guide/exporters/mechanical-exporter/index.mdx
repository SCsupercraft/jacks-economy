# Mechanical Exporter

The exporter allows you to **automatically** sell items using **kinetic energy.**

<img
	src={block}
	width="300"
	style={{
		'border-radius': '10px',
	}}
/>

## Get started

The exporter requires a manifest to function and without it, it is **useless.**
Once you have acquired a **suitable manifest,** simply put it in the **manifest slot** and the exporter will start to sell **any items listed on the manifest.**
If the manifest is **golden** the exporter well be able to sell **any sellable** item.

### Power

You can **power** the mechanical exporter by **turning the shaft** on the **back** of the exporter.

<img
	src={back}
	width="300"
	style={{
		'border-radius': '10px',
	}}
/>
