# Importer

The importer allows you to **automatically** buy items using **energy.**

<img
	src={block}
	width="300"
	style={{
		'border-radius': '10px',
	}}
/>

## Get started

The importer requires a manifest to function and without it, it is **useless.**
Once you have acquired a **suitable manifest,** simply put it in the **manifest slot** and select **one item** on the manifest for the importer to buy.
The importer will now start to buy the **selected** item.

### Power

You can **power** the importer using **FE** (Forge Energy), you can use **any mod** to get the energy to the importer.
The importer can be powered from **any side.**
