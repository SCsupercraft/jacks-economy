# Mechanical Importer

The importer allows you to **automatically** buy items using **kinetic energy.**

<img
	src={block}
	width="300"
	style={{
		'border-radius': '10px',
	}}
/>

## Get started

The importer requires a manifest to function and without it, it is **useless.**
Once you have acquired a **suitable manifest,** simply put it in the **manifest slot** and select **one item** on the manifest for the importer to buy.
The importer will now start to buy the **selected** item.

### Power

You can **power** the mechanical importer by **turning the shaft** on the **back** of the importer.

<img
	src={back}
	width="300"
	style={{
		'border-radius': '10px',
	}}
/>
