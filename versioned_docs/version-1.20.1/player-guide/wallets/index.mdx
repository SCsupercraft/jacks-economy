## Usage

### Default Currency Mode

This is the gui for the wallet in **default currency mode**.

#### Inputting Money

You can input money by moving coins, bills and checks from your inventory into the wallet's gui.\
This can be by **dragging** or **shift-clicking** the money you are inputting.

You can also click the **deposit all** button to input all money in your inventory.\
Stacks of bill and piles of coins **can not** be inputted, instead place and break them to get their uncompacted form.

#### Removing Money

You can remove money by **left-clicking** the coins and bills in the wallet's gui.\
By holding **CTRL** and **left-clicking** you can take out **10 items** in one click and by holding **SHIFT** you can take out a **whole stack**.

You can also click the check icon to **write a check**, which can store an **infinite amount of money**.

#### Capacity Overflow

:::note

In the future you will **no longer** be able to reach **capacity overflow**, instead you will either be **given change** or not be able to add the money in the first place.

:::

You may have seen a message saying **'Capacity Overflow Reached'** and wondered what is capacity overflow?\
Capacity overflow is where you have **more money** in your wallet than it is **meant to hold**.

**What happens when your wallet is overflowing?**

While you will still be able to **use your wallet as normal** and **spend** the **extra money**, you can not put any more money into your wallet.

### Single Item Currency Mode

This is the gui for the wallet in **single item currency mode**.\
It has **15 slots** where you can put dollar bills. These slots **act like a chest**.
