# Returning Manifest Items

:::note

By default items are returned when creating manifests.

:::

While having items being **returned when creating manifests** is useful, if you want players on your server or modpack to be able to **make their own manifests** you probably **don't want the items to be returned**.

If you don't want items to be returned when **creating manifests** set `returnManifestItems` to false.
