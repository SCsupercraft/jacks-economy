# Setting up the Admin Shop

:::tip[RECOMMENDATION]

While you can have an **infinite** amount of categories and pages it is **not recommended** to have more than ten categories (in each set), to make it easier to find the category you are looking for.

:::

The admin shop is made up of **two sets of categories** and **one set of pages**.\
Categories allow you to **categorize items** so that they are easier to find.
Pages contain items that can be bought.
