# Item Manifests

Item manifests are **used by importers and exporters** and tell them what items can be bought/sold.
To **create a new manifest** first grab an **empty manifest**, hold it in your hand and **right-click**.

Put **any items** you want in the **manifest's gui** to add them to the manifest, once you are done adding items simply **close the gui** to create the manifest with the added items.
If enabled items added to the manifest **will be returned**.
You will see a **command in chat** that was **automatically generated** for you, this command can be used to give someone the *exact manifest* you just made.
