# Setting Up The Admin Shop

The admin shop is made up of **two sets of categories** and **one set of pages**.

/>
<img
	src={gui2}
	width="550"
/>

Categories allow you to **categorize items** so that they are easier to find.
Pages are where the items are kept.\
While you can have an **infinite amount of categories and pages** it is not recommended as you can only scroll down using the mouse wheel and you can only scroll left and right using the buttons on screen.

## Categories

### Creating a Category

You can create a category by dragging an item **from your inventory** onto one of the category sets.
This item is the new category's icon.
Then you can give the new category a name.

### Renaming a Category

By **right-clicking** on a category you can rename it.

### Removing a Category

You can remove a category by **middle-clicking** the category you want to remove.

## Pages

### Adding an Item

You can add an item by dragging an item **from your inventory** onto a page.
Then you can give the item a price.
You now have a buyable item.

### Repricing an Item

### Renaming an Item
