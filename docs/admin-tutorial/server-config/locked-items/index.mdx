# Locked items

:::note

By default names and stages for locked items are hidden.

:::

As you can see **by default** when hovering over a **locked item** in the admin shop you **don't get any information** on what the item might be or **what you need to unlock it**.
This can be changed using the config.

By changing a few settings in the config you can get locked items to look like they do in the image below.

<img src={gui2} width="550"/>

There are two settings for changing how locked items in the admin shop should look.
These are `showNamesForLockedAdminShopItems` and `showStageForLockedAdminShopItems`.
By setting them to either **true or false** you can decide whether or not to **show the names of the locked items** and their **required game stage**.

Similarly you can show the **required game stage** of **locked sell items** by setting `showStageForLockedSellItems` to true.
