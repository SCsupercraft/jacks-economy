# Admin Shop Command

:::note

By default only operators can use `/adminshop`.

:::

`/adminshop` can be used to access the admin shop from **anywhere in the world**.

By changing `adminShopCommandForEveryone` to true you can allow everyone to use `/adminshop`.\
Keep it set to false to *only* allow operators to use the command.
