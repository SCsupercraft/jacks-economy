# The Currency Converter

The currency converter can convert your money into **different forms** of currency, such as a dime or a dollar bill.

## Using The Currency Converter

In order to use the currency converter first **select** the form of currency you are converting to.
To change what you are converting to click on the currency in the **center of the gui**.
This will change which form of currency you are converting to.

When in the gui you can **input** money on the left and **take out** money on the right.
You can **automate** this process using the [Create Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) by using funnels and chutes
to input items into and to take out the result from the **designated sides** of the currency converter.\
