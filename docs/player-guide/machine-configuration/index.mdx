# Machine Configuration

Certain blocks may be configurable, this means you can change where the block's inputs and outputs are located.
To access a block's configuration click on the **cogwheel** in the top-right of the block's gui.

In the config you will see **6 tiles** each representing one side of the block.
**Hovering** over a tile you tell you what side it is and whether it is an **input**, **output**, **rejection output** or if it is **not used** at all.
A rejection output is where an item will go if it was rejected by the block.
For an example an oak log would be rejected if it was put into a currency converter.

You can cycle what a side of the block is used for by **clicking** on the tile which represents that side.
