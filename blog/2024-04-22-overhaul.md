Hello everyone! In the *not so distant future*, we are looking to expand and overhaul Jack's Economy to get it to a place where it is more **feature-complete**! This includes possibly implementing long awaited features such as **player shops**, **banks**, **fluid importers and exporters**, etc. as well as *various* tweaks.

To get an idea of what we are roughly planning and to contribute your own ideas and suggestions for specific things, check out the **new channel category** for suggestions!  We have some pretty good direction for certain things but **community feedback** and **suggestions** are paramount! Please see if one of the existing channels fits the category of your suggestion and place it there!\
You can find the new channels in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/3F8gBbMCXU).

Also if you are an artist/animator and would like to give ideas or **contribute** please make yourself known in ‚Å†general.

And always thanks for the support!
