**Major Release!**

- Added [Create Integration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) (automatic exporter and importer blocks powered by rotational power)
- Revamped all GUIs
- Added some sounds and particle effects to some machines
- All machines and wallets now have a configurable 'soft cap' capacity. If it is set to $1000, for example, the machine or wallet will accept money until it is at least one penny over 1000. This allows for machines and wallets to be able to reach max capacity without worrying about exact change.
- Added additional category configuration to the admin shop
- Bug fixes and more...
