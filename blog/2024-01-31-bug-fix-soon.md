We are aware of some *big bugs* on the latest version; most notably the **packet size error** bug!

Due to *sickness* and being *busy irl*, it has taken a little while to come up with and implement changes to help these issues but thanks to [Khajiitos](https://www.curseforge.com/members/khajiitos/projects) we finally have some potential solutions! 

I and others are working to test and tweak them asap and hopefully we can get an update pushed soon™️ Stay tuned!
