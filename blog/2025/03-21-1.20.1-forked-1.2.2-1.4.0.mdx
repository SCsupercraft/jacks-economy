  - If advanced tooltips is enabled, you can **hover** over an admin shop in your inventory to get its name
  - Translation keys can be used as a shop's name, and will be replaced correctly
- `/adminshop` has 3 new sub-commands, which are **operator only**
  - `default` opens the default admin shop (no name)
  - `named <admin_shop_name>` opens the admin shop with the specified name
  - `name <admin_shop_name>` names the admin shop in your hand to the specified name (this is *different* to using an anvil)
