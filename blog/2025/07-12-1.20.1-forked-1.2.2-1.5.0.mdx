### Added

- **Manifest Usage Limits**: You can now define a maximum number of uses for manifests via `/economy manifest max_uses`.
- **Admin Shop Coloring**: Admin shops can be color-coded using `/adminshop color` to help differentiate them. This is especially useful since each shop's inventory is linked to its name.
