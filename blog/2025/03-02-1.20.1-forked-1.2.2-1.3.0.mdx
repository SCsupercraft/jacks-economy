import { CurseforgeLink, ModrinthLink } from '/src/components/content';

### Added
- Added a new `/economy` command
  - This replaces the `/price` command
- Added fluid variants of exporters and importers
  - Added ponders to go with these new variants
- You can now customize the amount of items an importer or exporter can buy/sell at once
  - This depends on the max process count of the used manifest
  - You can change the max process count using `/economy manifest max_process_count`
### Fixed
- Fixed a server-side only crash from `1.2.0`
