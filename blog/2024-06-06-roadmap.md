Hey everyone! I know things have been kind of slow and quiet due to being busy and away IRL, but I wanted to go ahead and post a **tentative roadmap** for what [Khajiitos](https://www.curseforge.com/members/khajiitos/projects) and I are planning for the next update(s) ðŸ™‚ 
<!-- truncate -->
In rough chronological order of development:

1. [Capacity overflow](/docs/player-guide/wallets#capacity-overflow) tweaks for wallets; overflowing would now spawn change
2. **Configurable** and improved wallet HUD, including options to display total money in your inventory, backpacks, etc without a wallet or in addition to the wallet
3. **Configurable** option to allow players to use money from their inventory in the admin shop *in addition to* or *instead of* the wallet (which also means allowing the admin shop to make change, improving the GUI to give a place for change to be spawned, a place for inventory bills and coins to be inserted, etc)
4. Add a optionally enabled *infinite* wallet item with no capacity limit
5. [One Item Currency Mode](/docs/admin-tutorial/server-config/currency-modes#single-item-currency-mode) parity with some of the above features
6. Optional toggle button for wallets that allow them to **auto-pickup** ground currency and deposit it straight to the wallet
7. Price creation **QOL** enhancement for admins (most likely this would look like a sort of block and item file browser that would look like the creative inventory with a search bar and tabs that would allow the selection of multiple items at once to set prices) rather than doing them one at a time by hand.
8. Manifest improvements (mainly, allowing importers to round robin multiple items at a time off of a manifest)
9. Textures, animations, **ponder scenes**, etc.
10. New blocks/machines like banks and **player shops**, **fluid importers and exporters**
11. New mechanics like **land renting**, tax, sales and specials, etc
