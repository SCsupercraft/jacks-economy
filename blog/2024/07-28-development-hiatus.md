Hello everyone! 

Jacks Economy will *unfortunately* be taking a **break from development** for the time being. IRL is crazy! 

Obviously the [discord server](https://discord.gg/3F8gBbMCXU) will still be active for questions, but until our lead dev returns and/or we find the time to work on updates, the mod is pretty much *as-is* right now. 

Thank you for understanding, and hopefully someday not too far off we will resume work on our planned features and improvements!
