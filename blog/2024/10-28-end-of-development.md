Hello! **Official development** for Jack's Economy has been and will be *dead* for the **foreseeable future** and I haven't had as much time to put into the mod as I had hoped-clearly!
<!-- truncate -->
That being said, we have a **wonderful**, **active** **community** and this announcement serves as me **granting a blanket permission** for *anyone* to make addons, textures, modpacks, tutorials, wikis, and **other content** etc. using Jack's Economy as long as you aren't **directly selling the mod** and **it's assets** for money or claiming it's your own (without credit). So no need to ask me in the future, I will probably take *forever* to respond if I ever do at all.

Also please link any creations in the [discord](https://discord.gg/3F8gBbMCXU) for everyone else to see and use! 

Have fun!
